# TimerClass
Object Oriented Fortran 2003 Timer Class.

This TimerClass is developed to serve as an example of Object Oriented programming
in Fortran 2003. It is part of a series of modern Fortran tutorials published on my 
[webpage](https://dannyvanpoucke.be) :
1. Tutorial OOP(III): [Constructors and Destructors](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/oop-fortran-tut4-en/)
2. Tutorial OOP(IV) : [Operator and Assignment Overloading](https://dannyvanpoucke.be/oop-fortran-tut5-en/)
3. Tutorial OOP(V)  : Privacy in Classes
4. Tutorial OOP(VI) : Doxygen Documentation of Classes

This TimerClass is, however, not solely developed for the purpose of these tutorials. It
also is intended as an upgrade of my former timer and timing functions of my HIVE-toolbox.
